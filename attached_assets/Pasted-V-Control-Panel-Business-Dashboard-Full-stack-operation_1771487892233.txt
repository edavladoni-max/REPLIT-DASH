VЛАДОНИ Control Panel — Business Dashboard

Full-stack operational dashboard for a multi-location foodtruck business (Saint Petersburg, Russia). Connected to a Python backend server via REST API running on a remote VPS (credentials stored in secret VPS_VL as user@ip:password).

Tech Stack:
- Backend proxy: Node.js/Express server that connects to VPS via SSH tunnel and forwards API calls to the Python server running on port 18789 (OpenClaw gateway)
- Frontend: Vanilla JS + HTML/CSS (no frameworks), served as static files
- Language: Russian interface
- Timezone: Europe/Moscow (UTC+3)

Core API endpoints on VPS port 18789:
GET /api/state → full dashboard state
GET /api/routines → recurring task routines
GET /api/overrides → schedule overrides
GET /api/salary/calculate → payroll calculation
GET /api/order/catalog → supplier order catalog
POST /api/tasks/add → add task
POST /api/tasks/toggle → check/uncheck task
POST /api/shifts/save → save shift edits
POST /api/grid/assign → assign employee to shift cell
POST /api/sync → trigger workspace sync
POST /api/day/regenerate → regenerate today's task snapshot

/api/state returns JSON with: today date, today_shifts, location_statuses (ФЛАГШТОК/SOUND/SPACEBOX), tasks_today, supplier_deadlines (ИМБИРЬ 13:30, ВОДАМОЛОКО 16:00, САЙРАНФУД 19:00), deliveries, finance, key_dates, shift_grid (week grid with employees), priority_queue, hot_zone (overdue tasks/alerts), daily_checklist, employees list.

Dashboard has 7 tabs (all in Russian):
1. Главная — current day: location statuses with color badges (working/events_only/closed), today's shifts, hot zone (overdue tasks, alerts in red), supplier deadlines countdown, finance card, key dates
2. Задачи — task checkboxes with optimistic toggle via POST /api/tasks/toggle, priority colors, daily checklist with time labels, recurring tasks
3. Смены — weekly grid (ФЛАГШТОК × SOUND × SPACEBOX Алпенхаус, Mon–Sun), employee assignment per cell, shift times, staffing completeness indicator
4. Поставщики — supplier order constructor by vendor, catalog items, deadline confirmation
5. Финансы — revenue/cash/card per day per location
6. Журнал — event log feed for the day
7. Расписание/Зарплата — weekly schedule draft, salary calculation by hours × rate

UX rules:
- Sticky header: shows clock (MSK live), company name VЛАДОНИ, tab navigation, today's date chip
- Dark theme with accent colors: red for alerts, green for OK, yellow for warnings
- Cards auto-refresh every 30s via GET /api/state
- Mobile-friendly: collapsible sections
- 3 locations: ФЛАГШТОК (active), SOUND (events only), SPACEBOX Алпенхаус (opens April 2026)

Business context:
- Foodtruck company, ~10 staff
- Suppliers: ИМБИРЬ (deadline 13:30), ВОДАМОЛОКО (16:00), САЙРАНФУД (19:00)
- Weekly payroll: calculated Tue, paid Wed

First: connect via SSH to VPS (VPS_VL secret = user@ip:password), test GET on port 18789 /api/state to see real data structure, then build the full dashboard based on actual response.
